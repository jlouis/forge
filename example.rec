%% This is an example record file for use with the code system

-record(foo
    { a = 10 :: integer() `field_a`,
      b = <<"Hello">> :: binary() `field_b`
    }).

%% This record definition maps to the following JSON structure:
%% 
%% {
%% 	"field_a" : 10,
%% 	"field_b" : "Hello"
%% }

%% And we will export the functions
%% from_json/1 and to_json/1 for this function in question when compiling from this spec.
